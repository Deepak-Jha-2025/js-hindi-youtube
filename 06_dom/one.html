<!-- DOM = Document Object Model
     Whether we use React or Angular, our entire html document is made up of
     objects like head, body. So, DOM refers to: 
     1. Our document is made up of which model? 
     2. What is it's structure? How does the page look like?

     Understanding these would help us in manipulating the page properly.

     Besides this, if we understand events:
     1. what should happen on a button click?
     2. what processes should happen? 
     3. whether requests to web server should be sent or not? etc.


     ***  The main purpose behind knowing the DOM is to know each element/object 
          has how many childs and siblings and how to reach/access them.   ***
