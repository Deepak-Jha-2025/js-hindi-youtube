    // The XML request being send is called (AJAX request)

    // 1st we make an object using the XMLHttpRequest() method
    // Through this method, we can send and receive data

    // This is almost equivalent to a class, so an object of this class is needed 
    // (made using the new keyword) and store its ref in some variable
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
    
    // open() method is used to send the API request
    // takes 2 parameters: 
    // 1. method: which means the type of request we want to send
    // 2. requestURL: the url from where we're requesting the data/api which will come as an object
    
    const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary'
    // console.log(xhr.readyState); // state = 0 (UNSENt)
    
    xhr.open('GET', requestUrl)  // the request hasn't been sent yet
    // console.log(xhr.readyState); // state = 1 (OPENED) b/z this state change happens synchronously
    
    // Open() is not called on its own, it needs .send() to be called 
    xhr.send() // this initiates the request, open() had just set the prequisites (like method, url)
    
    // console.log(xhr.readyState); // prints state = 1 and not 2? b/z the state change happens asynchronously (for rest refer chatgpt)
    
    // Continuously tracking the state
    // takes a function and executes it when state is changed continuously
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
        console.log(xhr.readyState);
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            // we get a response in return once the state = 4, i.e. the operatin is complete
            // const data = this.responseText // currently, we're in context of xhr object, so this gives that current context of xhr obj
            // console.log(data); 

            // console.log(typeof data); // String: the datatype of response received from url is String most of the times, so accessing properties using dot operator would give undefined

            // console.log(data.followers); // undefined

            const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText) // parse converts string into JSON
            console.log(typeof data);    // object
            console.log(data.followers); // now the properties are accessible

        }
    }
    
    /*
        As soon as we send request, it changes state continuously 
        (refer:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/readyState)
