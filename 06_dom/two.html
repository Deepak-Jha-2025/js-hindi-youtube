       the entire DOM is a tree structure and ultimatly we're traversing the entire tree. So, we don't want to traverse 
       the entire tree again.

       1. 1st, we've given a line break after the div element with parent class. That line break/enter key/new line 
          is also a text node element. Similarly every line break following subsequent div elements are nodes as well.  
          
       2. 2nd, the text content inside each element is also a text node.
       
       3. A nodelist is a collection of document nodes which includes text nodes , attribute nodes and element nodes. 
          A line break is also counted in nodelist but  if there are multiple ine breakes simultaneously or right after
          same node than they are ignored */
