        functions like setTimeout() and setInterval() are not just core functions,
        they are available through the browser (browser run-time env or some other 
        APIS). We know in Js engine we have only the memory heap and the call stack,
        but when these are called, then they go in the register call back in the 
        web api/node api, then through task queue, we get its access again. 

        Similarly, we have clearInterval() and clearTimeout()

       1st arg: handler is also a callback fnc (a fnc without a name
       or ref to some fnc)

       2nd arg: timeout in millisec

       Executes the code in the callback after given timeout (executes only once)

        document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = "best JS Series"
    }

    const changeMe = setTimeout(changeText, 2000) // it is a method but also an API

    /*
        Practical use case of setTimeout() is when we open any site and some 
        sort of pop up comes, or some bar comes up from the top (like a nav bar)
        regarding some events or discounts, etc.

        In case we want to stop the timeout from executing before the set time, we
        can use clearTimeout.

        hold the ref. of the setTimeout() in some variable, then pass it.
