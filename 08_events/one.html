    /*
        All events in Js run sequentially (i.e. Js is a sequentially run lang). 
        However, there are some exceptions, like Asynchronous programming, where
        the syncrhonous/sequential order is deviated and then returned back.

        One such exception are the browser events. These events invoke only upon
        some activity, it's not like just b/z we wrote them sequentially in the 
        file, so they'll just execute. They'll execute on some activity like
        mouse moved, keyboard pressed, mouse pressed, drag n drop, etc. (Refer
        events list)

        Injecting any event directly in the html ele is not a feasible approach 
        when it comes to scaling the application. (However, in react the code is 
        actually scalable, when we directly inject onclick="" on the buttons)

        Instead of that, we follow a 2nd approach:
        1. select the element by id
        2. apply an onclick event on that selected element
        3. then describe what would happen upon that click using a function
    */

    // document.getElementById('owl').onclick = function () {
    //     alert("owl clicked")
    // }

    /*
         This approach has problems as well. When we're applying onclick event 
         on the id element, then there may be some problems in that event b/z 
         we don't get much information. So we should rather use Event Listeners.
         That's b/z Event Listeners give us not just onclick functionality, but 
         also propagation ability as well (in simple words, gives more features
         whereas the onclick event gives less features)
 
         So, the 3rd and best approach so far: 
         1. select the elements by id/class/tag
 
         2. add an event listener to it
 
         3. event listener can listen to plenty of events like: keyboard events, 
            mouse events, drag and drop
 
         4. the 3rd parameter is false by default, so no need to explicitly pass it
         
         Another approach: attachEvent()
         jQuery -> on() (directly .on())
    */

    /* 
        Event object

        Mostly, we'll get browser events and environment events (like position
        where mouse clicked)
        
        // important events (self study)
        // type, timestamp, defaultPrevented
        // target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget
        // clientX, clientY, screenX, screenY
        // altkey, ctrlkey, shiftkey, keyCode
    */

    // document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    //     console.log(e);
    // }, false)

    /*
        Event propagation : has 2 contexts - 
        1. Event bubbling 
        2. Event capturing

        Mostly, event bubbling is used by default (i.e. false)
    */

    // document.getElementById('images').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    //     console.log("clicked inside the ul");
    // }, false)

    // document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    //     console.log("owl clicked");
    //     e.stopPropagation() // now this event won't bubble up to the outer event
    // }, false)

    /* 
        When we click on the 'owl' id ele (which was inside the 'images'), then 
        actually we're clicking on both as 'owl' is inside the 'images', so 'owl'
        has 2 events attached to it.

        Order:
        'owl' clicl event -> 1st
        'images' click event -> 2nd

        This is how event propagates (bubbling up), from the innermost to the 
        outermost. This is event bubbling. 

        This happens when the 3rd arg is false

        If it is true, then event propagation happens in capturing mode, which
        happens from top to bottom (outermost to innermost)
    */

    // To avoid bubbling, and separate the inner and outer elements, 
    // we use e.stopPropagation(), where e is the event captured

    // document.getElementById('google').addEventListener('click', function (e) {
    //     console.log("google clicked");
    //     e.preventDefault(); // prevents the default action of the event captured
    //     e.stopPropagation(); // stops bubbling up
    // }, false)

    // Trying to make an image (its entire <li>) disappear upon click
    document.querySelector('#images').addEventListener('click', function(e){
        console.log(e.target.tagName);

        if (e.target.tagName === 'IMG') {
            console.log(e.target.id);
            let removeIt = e.target.parentNode
            removeIt.remove() // removes the element
            // removeIt.parentNode.removeChild(removeIt)
        }

    }, false)
